# accpi (Accounts API)
## Accounts API for WebX. (Primarily for the use of max.btw and SmartLinuxUser, but you can also use this to integrate with your apps)
Hello all! This is a little project which is meant to be a rip off of OAuth from google. It's just meant to be a universal
way to log into whatever app you have made on WebX. It supports creating and logging into accounts, to access and to RW a
persons data (such as a password change, giving or taking coins, etc...) and will hopefully enable a system which doesn't
require you to make a new account for every WebX app you meet, but just log in with those very same credentials you use for
everything aswell!



**CURRENTLY NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, BUT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO USE IT ONCE IT DOES BECOME READILY AVAILABLE**
