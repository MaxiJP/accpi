It supports creating and logging into accounts, to access and to RW a\r persons data (such as a password change, giving or taking coins, etc...) and will hopefully enable a system which doesn't\r require you to make a new account for every WebX app you meet, but just log in with those very same credentials you use for\r everything aswell!",
